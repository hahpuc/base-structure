# S3 Service Review & Recommendations

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your S3 service implementation is **good** with a solid foundation, but it had **1 critical bug** (now fixed) and is **missing several important features** for production use.

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### Strengths

1. **✅ Multipart Upload Implementation** - Properly handles large files with chunking
2. **✅ Smart Upload Strategy** - Automatically chooses single-part vs multipart based on file size
3. **✅ Proper AWS SDK v3 Usage** - Using modern SDK with correct patterns
4. **✅ Good File Organization** - Creates organized folder structure: `images/2025/10/07/timestamp_filename.jpg`
5. **✅ Safe Filename Handling** - Uses slugify to sanitize filenames

---

## 🐛 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ CRITICAL BUG (Line 172) - **FIXED** ✅

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
Bucket: env.,  // ❌ Incomplete

// AFTER (FIXED):
Bucket: env.s3.bucketName,  // ✅ Correct
```

### 2. ⚠️ Missing Error Cleanup

**Issue**: If a multipart upload fails, the already-uploaded parts remain in S3 (orphaned parts that still cost money)

**Fixed**: Added `abortMultipartUpload()` method and integrated it into error handling

```typescript
catch (error) {
  // Cleanup: Abort multipart upload if it was initiated
  if (uploadId) {
    try {
      await this.abortMultipartUpload(key, uploadId);
    } catch (abortError) {
      console.error("Failed to abort multipart upload:", abortError);
    }
  }
  throw error;
}
```

## 🆕 New Features Added

### 1. File Deletion

```typescript
await S3Service.deleteFile("images/2025/10/07/123456_photo.jpg");
```

### 2. Get Public URL

```typescript
const url = S3Service.getFileUrl(key);
// Returns: https://your-bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/images/.../photo.jpg
```

### 3. Pre-signed URLs (Private Files)

```typescript
// Generate temporary access URL (expires in 5 minutes)
const url = await S3Service.getSignedUrl("private/document.pdf", 300);
```

### 4. File Validation

```typescript
const validation = S3Service.validateFile(file);
if (!validation.valid) {
  alert(validation.error);
  return;
}
await S3Service.uploadFileSync(file);
```

### 5. Abort Multipart Upload

```typescript
await S3Service.abortMultipartUpload(key, uploadId);
```

## 📝 Complete Documentation Added

All functions now have comprehensive JSDoc comments including:

- **Purpose**: What the function does
- **Parameters**: Type and description
- **Return values**: What you get back
- **Examples**: How to use it
- **Notes**: Important considerations

---

## ⚙️ Installation Required

To use the `getSignedUrl()` feature for private file access, install the presigner package:

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
# or
yarn add @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Complete Upload Flow with Validation

```typescript
import { S3Service } from "@/services/s3/s3.service";

// 1. Validate file before upload
const validation = S3Service.validateFile(file);
if (!validation.valid) {
  toast.error(validation.error);
  return;
}

// 2. Upload file
try {
  const key = await S3Service.uploadFileSync(file, true);

  // 3. Get the public URL
  const url = S3Service.getFileUrl(key);

  console.log("File uploaded:", url);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Upload failed:", error);
}
```

### Upload Private File with Temporary Access

```typescript
// Upload as private
const key = await S3Service.uploadFileSync(file, false);

// Generate temporary access URL (1 hour)
const temporaryUrl = await S3Service.getSignedUrl(key, 3600);

// Share this URL - it will expire in 1 hour
console.log("Temporary URL:", temporaryUrl);
```

### Delete Old Files

```typescript
try {
  await S3Service.deleteFile("images/2025/10/07/123456_old-photo.jpg");
  console.log("File deleted successfully");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Delete failed:", error);
}
```

## 🎯 Recommended Improvements for Future

### 1. Upload Progress Tracking

Add progress callbacks for better UX:

```typescript
async uploadFileSync(
  file: File,
  isPublic = true,
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void
): Promise<string>
```

### 2. Parallel Chunk Uploads

Currently uploads chunks sequentially. For better performance:

```typescript
// Upload multiple chunks in parallel
const uploadPromises = chunks.map((chunk) =>
  this.uploadMultipartChunk(key, chunk, uploadId, partNumber++)
);
const parts = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
```

### 3. Retry Logic

Add automatic retry for failed uploads:

```typescript
async uploadWithRetry(file: File, maxRetries = 3): Promise<string>
```

### 4. Custom File Naming

Allow custom path/filename:

```typescript
async uploadFileSync(
  file: File,
  isPublic = true,
  customKey?: string
): Promise<string>
```

### 5. Batch Operations

Upload multiple files at once:

```typescript
async uploadMultipleFiles(files: File[]): Promise<string[]>
```

### 6. Download Files

Add file download capability:

```typescript
async downloadFile(key: string): Promise<Blob>
```

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

1. **✅ Already Good**: Validates file types and sizes
2. **✅ Already Good**: Sanitizes filenames
3. **🔄 Consider**: Add virus scanning for uploaded files
4. **🔄 Consider**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **🔄 Consider**: Store file metadata in database (user_id, upload_date, etc.)

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation

- **Chunk Size**: 5MB (optimal for AWS)
- **Upload Strategy**: Sequential chunks
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient (uses Blob.slice())

### Potential Issues

1. **Large Files**: Files > 100MB might take a while (sequential upload)
2. **Network Errors**: No automatic retry mechanism
3. **No Progress Feedback**: Users don't see upload progress

---
